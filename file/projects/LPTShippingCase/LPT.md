## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation:
- Collected raw data related to shippers, customers, delivery numbers, and profits.
- Cleaned and standardized data, addressing inconsistencies such as non-homogeneous attributes and improper formats (e.g., billable rate per mile column).

### Data Modeling:
- Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) for analysis, including profit, number of deliveries, and delivery delays.
- Used data modeling techniques within **Pyramid Analytics** to create relationships between shippers, customers, and deliveries.

### KPI Analysis:
- Performed statistical analysis, including aggregations and histograms, to explore correlations between KPIs.
- Analyzed the relationship between the number of deliveries and profit, and examined delivery times across different shippers.

### Challenges Addressed:
- Resolved issues with data non-uniformity and format inconsistencies.
- Managed complex relationships between different data attributes to ensure accurate analysis.
